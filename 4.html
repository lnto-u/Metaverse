  <h2>Criticism and concerns</h2>

  <p>Information privacy is an area of concern for metaverses because related
  companies will likely collect users' personal information through
  interactions and biometric data from wearable virtual reality devices.
   Facebook is planning on employing targeted advertising within their
   metaverse, raising further worries related to the spread of misinformation
   and loss of personal privacy.</p>

   <p> User addiction and problematic social media use is another concern.
     Internet addiction disorder, social media, and video game addiction can
     have mental and physical repercussions over a prolonged period of time,
     such as depression, anxiety, and various other harms related to having a
     sedentary lifestyle. Experts are also concerned that metaverses could be
      used as an 'escape' from reality in a similar fashion to existing internet
   technologies.</p>

   <p>Metaverses may magnify the social impacts of online echo chambers and
     digitally alienating spaces. They may abuse common social media engagement
     strategies to further distort users' perceptions of reality with biased
     content.</p>

   <p>In a 2021 interview Elon Musk said he couldnâ€™t see a compelling use-case
     for the VR-driven metaverse.</p>
