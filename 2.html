  <h2>Implications</h2>

    <li><h3>Video games</h3></li>
    <p> Several components of metaverse technologies have already been developed
      within modern internet-enabled video games.The 2003 virtual world platform
       Second Life is often described as the first metaverse,as it incorporated many
      aspects of social media into a persistent three-dimensional world with the
      user represented as an avatar. Social functions are often an integral feature
       in many massively multiplayer online games. Technology journalist
       Clive Thompson has argued that the emergent, social-based gameplay of
       Minecraft represents an advanced analog of a metaverse. Similar statements
       were made for the game Roblox, which has since employed significant
       usage of the term in marketing. Other claims of developing a metaverse
       include the games Active Worlds, The Palace, Decentraland, and Fortnite.

    <li><h3>Virtual reality</h3></li>
    <p>Metaverse development has often focused on bettering virtual reality
    technologies due to benefits in establishing immersion in virtual environments.
    </p>
    <p>In 2019, the social network company Facebook launched a social VR world called
    Facebook Horizon.In 2021 Facebook was renamed "Meta Platforms" and
    its chairman Mark Zuckerberg declared a company commitment to developing
    a metaverse. Many of the virtual reality technologies advertised by Meta
    Platforms remains to be developed. Facebook whistleblower Frances
    Haugen criticised the move, adding that Meta Platforms' continued focus on
    growth-oriented projects is largely done to the detriment of ensuring safety on
     their platforms. Meta Platforms has also faced user safety criticism regarding
      Horizon Worlds due to the occurrence of sexual harassment on the platform.
