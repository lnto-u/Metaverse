  <h2>Technology</h2>
  <p>The metaverse is a proposed expansion to existing internet technologies.
  Potential access points for metaverses include general-purpose computers
  and smartphones, in addition to augmented reality (AR), mixed reality,
  virtual reality (VR), extended reality (XR) and virtual world technologies.
  </p>


  <p>Business and commercial interest in metaverse-related research and technology
  include Facebook, which bought VR company Oculus in 2014, and has announced
  plans to build a 3-D social space to connect varying services. </p>

  <p>A common dependence on VR technology places limitations on metaverse
  development and wide-scale adoption. Limitations stemming from the balance
  between cost and design include the lack of high-quality graphics and a lack of
   mobility. Lightweight wireless headsets lack image quality, which is optimized
   for bulky, wired VR goggle systems. Another issue for wide-scale adoption
   of the technology is the cost, with the HTC Vive Pro 2 headset costing US$799
   plus controllers in 2021.</p>

  <p>In 2021, the South Korean government announced the creation of a national
  metaverse alliance with the goal to build a unified national VR and AR platform.

  <h3>Technical standards</h3>
  <p>Common standards, interfaces, and communication protocols among virtual
  environments are in development. Collaborations and working groups are
  attempting to create standards and protocols to support interoperability
  between virtual environments, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>OpenXR, application programming interfaces (APIs) for interfacing with VR
      and AR devices, Khronos Group (2019–present)</li>
    <li>Virtual Worlds—Standard for Systems Virtual Components Working Group
      (P1828), IEEE (2010–Present)</li>
    <li>Information technology—Media context and control—Part 4: Virtual world
      object characteristics (ISO/IEC 23005-4:2011),[40] ISO (2008–Present)</li>
    <li>Immersive Education Technology Group (IETG),[41] Media Grid
      (2008–Present)</li>
    <li>Virtual World Region Agent Protocol (VWRAP),[42] IETF (2009–2011)</li>
    <li>The Metaverse Roadmap,[43] Acceleration Studies Foundation (2006–2007)
    </li>
    <li>The Open Source Metaverse Project (2004–2008)</li>
    <li>X3D, the successor to the Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) as
       the open standard for interactive real-time 3D (web3D). X3D is an
       accepted standard for integrating virtual and augmented realities
       with the web.</li></ul>
